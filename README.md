# misc
I'm sharing here general info and best practices I learn as I progress with my 42 projects.  
Something that seemed very useful to share at first is this little guide with essential commands and examples to [start working with remote repositories](Github-how-to.md).  

Enjoy it, I hope it helps ! :)
